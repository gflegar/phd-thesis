We present a set of new batched CUDA kernels for the LU factorization of 
a large collection of independent problems of different size, and the subsequent triangular solves.
All kernels heavily exploit the registers of the graphics processing unit (GPU) in order to deliver high
performance for small problems. The development of these kernels
is motivated by the need for tackling this embarrasingly-parallel scenario in the context of 
block-Jacobi preconditioning 
that is relevant for the iterative solution of sparse linear systems.
Our experimental comparison 
with existing CUDA kernels offering similar functionality, 
including those in NVIDIA's cuBLAS library,
on a state-of-the-art NVIDIA P100 GPU,
reveal significant performance advantages of our kernels.
