\section{Concluding Remarks and Future Work}
\label{2017-lu-block-jacobi:sec:summary}

We have presented flexible-size batched CUDA kernels for the solution of linear systems via the LU 
factorization that are optimized for small-size problems
and outperform existing counterparts offering the same functionality by a large margin. 
This performance is achieved by extensive use of the GPU registers, and
the integration of an implicit pivoting technique that preserves numerical stability
while removing the costly data movements due to the row exchanges.

Combined with an efficient strategy for the extraction of the diagonal blocks from a sparse data structure,
we have presented an ecosystem of a factorization-based block-Jacobi preconditioner
which succeeds in reducing the time-to-solution of the iterative IDR(4) Krylov method for a large range of problems.

Future work will address the development of a Cholesky-based variant 
for symmetric positive definite problems and the optimization of the batched kernels for any problem size.
