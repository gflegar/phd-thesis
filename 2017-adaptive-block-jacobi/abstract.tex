We propose an adaptive scheme to reduce communication overhead caused by data
movement by selectively storing the diagonal blocks of a block Jacobi 
preconditioner
in different precision formats (half, single, or double). This specialized
preconditioner can then be combined with any Krylov subspace method for the
solution of sparse linear systems to perform all arithmetic in double
precision. We assess the effects of the adaptive precision preconditioner on the
iteration count and data transfer cost of a preconditioned conjugate gradient 
solver. A preconditioned conjugate gradient method is, in general, a memory 
bandwidth-bound algorithm, and therefore
its execution time and energy consumption are largely dominated by the costs of
accessing the problem's data in memory. Given this observation, we propose a
model that quantifies the time and energy savings of our approach based on the
assumption that these two costs depend linearly on the bit length of a floating
point number. Furthermore, we use a number of test problems from the SuiteSparse
matrix collection to estimate the potential benefits of the adaptive
block-Jacobi preconditioning scheme.
