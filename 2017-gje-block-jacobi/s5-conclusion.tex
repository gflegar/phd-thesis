\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:s5-summary}
In this paper, we presented an enhanced, variable-size batched matrix inversion routine for
GPUs based on the GJE process. Our approach replaces
explicit pivoting with a strategy that reassigns the workload instead of
shuffling the data and relies heavily on CUDA's latest warp-local communication
features. As a result, our matrix inversion kernel is more flexible and
significantly outperforms its counterparts in the cuBLAS library.
In the framework of block-Jacobi preconditioning, we combined the batched matrix
inversion procedure with efficient routines for extracting the diagonal blocks
from the sparse data structures (where the problem matrix is stored) and inserting
the inverse blocks back into the preconditioner. We also addressed the efficient
preconditioner application
by developing a structure-aware batched kernel for the sparse matrix-vector
product that accommodates variable-size matrix operands. Finally, we
demonstrated that block Jacobi can be significantly more efficient than a scalar
Jacobi when preconditioning iterative solvers.
