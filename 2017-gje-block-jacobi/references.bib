	Abstract = {Lanczos type algorithms form a wide and interesting class of iterative methods for solving systems of linear equations. One of their main interest is that they provide the exact answer in at mostn steps wheren is the dimension of the system. However a breakdown can occur in these algorithms due to a division by a zero scalar product. After recalling the so-called method of recursive zoom (MRZ) which allows to jump over such breakdown we propose two new variants. Then the method and its variants are extended to treat the case of a near-breakdown due to a division by a scalar product whose absolute value is small which is the reason for an important propagation of rounding errors in the method. Programming the various algorithms is then analyzed and explained. Numerical results illustrating the processes are discussed. The subroutines corresponding to the algorithms described can be obtained vianetlib.},

	Abstract = {The biconjugate gradient (BCG) method is the ``natural'' generalization of the classical conjugate gradient algorithm for Hermitian positive definite matrices to general non-Hermitian linear systems. Unfortunately, the original BCG algorithm is susceptible to possible breakdowns and numerical instabilities. In this paper, we present a novel BCG-like approach, the quasi-minimal residual (QMR) method, which overcomes the problems of BCG. An implementation of QMR based on a look-ahead version of the nonsymmetric Lanczos algorithm is proposed. It is shown how BCG iterates can be recovered stably from the QMR process. Some further properties of the QMR approach are given and an error bound is presented. Finally, numerical experiments are reported.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The integration of the stiff \{ODE\} systems associated with chemical kinetics is the most computationally demanding task in most practical combustion simulations. The introduction of detailed reaction mechanisms in multi-dimensional simulations is limited by unfavorable scaling of the stiff \{ODE\} solution methods with the mechanism's size. In this paper, we compare the efficiency and the appropriateness of direct and Krylov subspace sparse iterative solvers to speed-up the integration of combustion chemistry ODEs, with focus on their incorporation into multi-dimensional \{CFD\} codes through operator splitting. A suitable preconditioner formulation was addressed by using a general-purpose incomplete \{LU\} factorization method for the chemistry Jacobians, and optimizing its parameters using ignition delay simulations for practical fuels. All the calculations were run using a same efficient framework: SpeedCHEM, a recently developed library for gas-mixture kinetics that incorporates a sparse analytical approach for the \{ODE\} system functions. The solution was integrated through direct and Krylov subspace iteration implementations with different backward differentiation formula integrators for stiff \{ODE\} systems: LSODE, VODE, DASSL. Both ignition delay calculations, involving reaction mechanisms that ranged from 29 to 7171 species, and multi-dimensional internal combustion engine simulations with the \{KIVA\} code were used as test cases. All solvers showed similar robustness, and no integration failures were observed when using ILUT-preconditioned Krylov enabled integrators. We found that both solver approaches, coupled with efficient function evaluation numerics, were capable of scaling computational time requirements approximately linearly with the number of species. This allows up to three orders of magnitude speed-ups in comparison with the traditional dense solution approach. The direct solvers outperformed Krylov subspace solvers at mechanism sizes smaller than about 1000 species, while the Krylov approach allowed more than 40% speed-up over the direct solver when using the largest reaction mechanism with 7171 species. },

	Abstract = {A Helmholtz equation in two dimensions discretized by a second order finite difference scheme is considered. Krylov methods such as Bi-CGSTAB and IDR( s ) have been chosen as solvers. Since the convergence of the Krylov solvers deteriorates with increasing wave number, a shifted Laplace multigrid preconditioner is used to improve the convergence. The implementation of the preconditioned solver on \{CPU\} (Central Processing Unit) is compared to an implementation on \{GPU\} (Graphics Processing Units or graphics card) using \{CUDA\} (Compute Unified Device Architecture). The results show that preconditioned Bi-CGSTAB on \{GPU\} as well as preconditioned IDR( s ) on \{GPU\} is about 30 times faster than on \{CPU\} for the same stopping criterion. },

	Abstract = {This paper details the concept and implementation of the parallel finite element software package HiFlow3 . HiFlow3 is driven by application requirements and aims at the solution of large-scale problems obtained by means of the finite element method for partial differential equations. By utilizing object-oriented concepts and the full capabilities of C++ the HiFlow3 project follows a modular and generic approach for building efficient parallel numerical solvers. It provides highly capable modules dealing with the mesh setup, finite element spaces, degrees of freedom, linear algebra routines, numerical solvers, and output data for visualization. Parallelism -- as the basis for high performance simulations on modern computing systems -- is introduced on two levels: coarse-grained parallelism by means of distributed grids and distributed data structures, and fine-grained parallelism by means of platform-optimized linear algebra back-ends. Modern numerical schemes in HiFlow3 are built on top of both levels of parallelism. This paper describes the project, its concept, and application scenarios in detail and outlines our hardware-aware cross-platform portable approach that benefits from various emerging technologies like GPU acceleration in a unified and user-friendly manner.},

While different technologies are available, graphic processing units (GPUs) have been established as particularly powerful coprocessors in recent years. For this reason, our error correction approach is focused on a CUDA implementation executing the error correction solver on the GPU. Benchmarks are performed both for artificially created matrices with preset characteristics as well as matrices obtained from finite element discretizations of fluid flow problems.},

Exact knowledge about the convergence theory of error correction methods using different floating point precision formats would enable to determine a priori whether the implementation of a mixed precision error correction solver using a certain 
Krylov subspace method as error correction solver outperforms the plain solver in high precision. This paper reveals characteristics of mixed precision error correction methods using Krylov subspace methods as inner solver.},

Our test-cases arise in the context of computational fluid dynamics. Therefore, we analyze the energy efficiency of common cluster nodes and a hybrid, GPU-accelerated cluster node, when applying a linear solver, that can benefit from the use of different precision formats. We show the high potential of hardware-aware computing in terms of performance and energy efficiency.},

@proceedings{powerawareclusters,
	Abstract = {With the advent of Cloud computing, large-scale virtualized compute and data centers are becoming common in the computing industry. These distributed systems leverage commodity server hardware in mass quantity, similar in theory to many of the fastest Supercomputers in existence today. However these systems can consume a cities worth of power just to run idle, and require equally massive cooling systems to keep the servers within normal operating temperatures. This produces CO2 emissions and significantly contributes to the growing environmental issue of Global Warming. Green computing, a new trend for high-end computing, attempts to alleviate this problem by delivering both high performance and reduced power consumption, effectively maximizing total system efficiency.
This paper focuses on scheduling virtual machines in a compute cluster to reduce power consumption via the technique of Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS). Specifically, we present the design and implementation of an efficient scheduling algorithm to allocate virtual machines in a DVFS-enabled cluster by dynamically scaling the supplied voltages. The algorithm is studied via simulation and implementation in a multi-core cluster. Test results and performance discussion justify the design and implementation of the scheduling algorithm.},
