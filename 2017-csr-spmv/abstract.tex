We propose a novel parallel approach to compute the sparse matrix-vector
product (\spmv) on graphics processing units (GPUs), optimized for matrices 
with an irregular row distribution of the non-zero entries. Our algorithm
relies on the standard CSR format to store the sparse matrix, requires an inexpensive
pre-processing step,
and consumes only a minor amount of additional memory
compared with significantly more expensive GPU-specific sparse matrix layouts.
In addition,
we propose a simple heuristic to determine whether our method
or the standard CSR \spmv algorithm should be used for a specific matrix.
As a result, our proposal, combined with the standard CSR \spmv,
can be adopted as the default choice for the implementation
of \spmv in general-purpose sparse linear algebra libraries for GPUs.
